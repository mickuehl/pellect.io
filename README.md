# About pellect.io

pellect.io (latin: reading through) is a simple service to save and curate all the links you discover on the web.

It was created out of my frustration with many similar services that exist, or existed (delicio.us, anyone?) over the years, only to disappear into the void - and with them, many of bookmarks. Keeping bookmarks in the browser also sucks these days ...

Did I already mention that pellect.io is not social? I do not want to share my bookmarks, I do not want to 'star' or 'fav' some other guys' bookmarks and I do not care who else might think that I give a damm about his bookmarks.

And then there is the problem of stale bookmark lists. It is easy to collect hundreds of links in a short time but how many are still relevant after 3 weeks? Or how many sites already went to the dead-pool since you added the link? pellect.io is an experiment to address this issue.

And no, I'm not building an instapaper clone. In fact, both services are complimentary and I will integrate instapaper pretty soon.
