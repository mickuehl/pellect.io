		<h4>About pellect.io</h4>
		<p>pellect.io (<i>latin</i>: reading through) is a simple service to save and curate all the links you discover on the web.</p>
		<p>It was created out of my frustration with many similar services that exist, or existed (delicio.us, anyone?) over the years, only to disappear into the void 
			- and with them, many of bookmarks. Keeping bookmarks in the browser also sucks these days ...</p>
		<p>Did I already mention that I'm asocial? I do not want to share my bookmarks, I do not want to 'star' or 'fav' someone other guys' bookmarks and I do not care who else might think
			that I give a damm about his bookmarks. Paah!</p>
		<p>And then there is the problem of stale bookmark lists. It is easy to collect hundreds of links in a short time but how many of those are still relevant after 3 month? 
			Or who's site went to the dead-pool? pellect.io is also an experiment to address this issue.</p>
